[[`Blog`](https://rene.wang/)] [[`Project`](https://ai.rene.wang/)] [[`Demo`](https://segment-anything.com/demo)]

This repo includes some models. Each model has all basic knowledge you should know of that sub-fields of machine learning. No framework used, no ads, totally free.

Once finish all models, you'll get full basic knowledgement of machine learning and should read paper more easily.
